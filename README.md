# MOM: My own manual

Create your own help files with colors.

## Tips

1. Create symbolic link, alias, or simply rename to `mom`.
2. Add `complete -c mom` to your `.bashrc` to have an autocompletion of commands.
3. Put the folder with your help files to Dropbox by setting `InfoDir = ~/Dropbox/mom` in your `~/.momrc`.
